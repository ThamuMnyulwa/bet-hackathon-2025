## Usage Examples

### Transaction Approval Workflow
```typescript
// 1. Get transaction status
const status = await getTransactionStatus({
  transactionId: "tx_123",
  includeRiskDetails: true,
  includeUserContext: true
});

// 2. Assess risk and approve if safe
if (status.currentState.riskScore < 60) {
  const approval = await approvePayment({
    transactionId: "tx_123",
    reason: "Low risk transaction, standard approval"
  });
}

// 3. Update transaction if needed
await updateTransaction({
  transactionId: "tx_123",
  action: "ADD_NOTE",
  note: "Approved after risk assessment - score: 45"
});
```

### Alert Management Workflow
```typescript
// 1. Get recent alerts
const alerts = await getFraudAlerts({
  limit: 10,
  includeResolved: false,
  severity: "HIGH"
});

// 2. Manage specific alert
await manageAlert({
  alertId: "alert_456",
  action: "ESCALATE",
  escalationLevel: "SECURITY_OFFICER",
  note: "Multiple failed login attempts detected"
});

// 3. Assign for investigation
await manageAlert({
  alertId: "alert_456",
  action: "ASSIGN",
  assignTo: "security_team_lead",
  note: "Assigned for immediate investigation"
});
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

These new tools complement the existing agent capabilities:
- **Risk Assessment**: Integrated with `assessPaymentRisk` for comprehensive security evaluation
- **System Monitoring**: Works with `getSystemStatus` and `getSystemAnalytics` for holistic view
- **User Management**: Leverages `getSessionUser` and `getUserProfile` for context
- **Payment Processing**: Integrates with `initiatePayment` for complete payment workflows

## Benefits

1. **Autonomous Operations**: Agent can now handle complete transaction lifecycles without human intervention
2. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into system health, fraud patterns, and risk factors
3. **Intelligent Decision Making**: Context-aware recommendations and next steps
4. **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trails and metadata tracking for regulatory requirements
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated workflows reduce manual intervention and response times
6. **Risk Management**: Proactive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Next Steps

The agent now has comprehensive tools for:
- ✅ Transaction lifecycle management
- ✅ Risk assessment and approval workflows
- ✅ Fraud alert management and escalation
- ✅ System monitoring and analytics
- ✅ User context and device security
- ✅ Payment processing and validation

The agent can autonomously handle most operational tasks that previously required manual intervention through the frontend client.
