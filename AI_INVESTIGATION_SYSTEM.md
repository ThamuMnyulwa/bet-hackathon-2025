# AI-Powered Investigation System

## Overview

The AI-powered investigation system transforms security alert management from manual processes to intelligent, automated analysis. Using advanced pattern recognition, risk assessment algorithms, and machine learning insights, the system provides security teams with actionable intelligence and recommendations.

## üöÄ **Key Features**

### **Intelligent Alert Analysis**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring security patterns and anomalies
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates threat levels with confidence scores
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers historical data, device activity, and user behavior
- **Real-Time Insights**: Provides immediate analysis and recommendations

### **AI-Driven Recommendations**
- **Immediate Actions**: Critical security measures that must be taken immediately
- **Short-term Strategies**: Tactical responses for the next few hours/days
- **Long-term Solutions**: Strategic improvements for ongoing security enhancement

### **Advanced Security Intelligence**
- **Geographic Clustering**: Detects unusual location-based patterns
- **Time Pattern Analysis**: Identifies suspicious timing anomalies
- **Device Trust Scoring**: Evaluates device reliability and risk
- **Transaction Pattern Analysis**: Monitors payment behavior for fraud indicators

## üîç **How It Works**

### **1. Alert Context Gathering**
When an alert is triggered, the AI system automatically collects:

```typescript
// Context data collected for analysis
const context = {
  alert: {
    type: 'SIM_SWAP',
    severity: 'HIGH',
    description: 'SIM card change detected',
    metadata: { riskScore: 95, location: 'Cape Town' }
  },
  similarAlerts: 3, // Similar alerts in last 24h
  recentTransactions: [...], // Last 20 transactions
  riskAssessments: [...], // Recent risk scores
  deviceActivity: [...] // Device trust and activity
}
```

### **2. Pattern Recognition Engine**
The AI analyzes multiple data points to identify patterns:

- **Alert Frequency**: How often similar alerts occur
- **Geographic Patterns**: Unusual location changes or clustering
- **Time Patterns**: Suspicious timing of activities
- **Amount Patterns**: Unusual transaction values
- **Device Patterns**: Suspicious device behavior
- **Risk Score Trends**: Changes in risk assessment over time

### **3. Risk Assessment Algorithm**
Comprehensive risk evaluation using multiple factors:

```typescript
const riskAnalysis = {
  threatLevel: 'HIGH', // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
  confidenceScore: 87, // Percentage confidence in assessment
  falsePositiveRisk: 'LOW', // Risk of false positive
  riskFactors: [
    'Critical severity alert',
    '3 high-risk assessments in recent history',
    '2 low-trust devices detected'
  ]
}
```

### **4. Intelligent Recommendations**
AI-generated action plans based on analysis:

```typescript
const recommendations = {
  immediate: [
    'Block suspicious IP addresses immediately',
    'Review recent high-value transactions'
  ],
  shortTerm: [
    'Enable additional authentication for affected user',
    'Implement enhanced monitoring for user'
  ],
  longTerm: [
    'Review and update security policies',
    'Implement machine learning-based anomaly detection'
  ]
}
```

### **Data Sources**
The AI system analyzes data from multiple sources:

1. **Fraud Alerts** (`fraudAlert` table)
   - Alert types, severity, descriptions
   - Metadata and contextual information
   - Historical alert patterns

2. **Payment Transactions** (`paymentTransaction` table)
   - Transaction amounts and patterns
   - Risk scores and status changes
   - Temporal and geographic data

3. **Risk Assessments** (`riskAssessment` table)
   - Historical risk scores
   - Risk factors and contributing elements
   - Assessment trends over time

4. **Device Fingerprints** (`deviceFingerprint` table)
   - Device trust scores
   - Device activity patterns
   - Geographic and temporal device usage

### **Analysis Algorithms**

#### **Pattern Recognition**
```typescript
function analyzePatterns(alert, similarAlerts, transactions) {
  const patterns = {
    alertFrequency: similarAlerts,
    geographicClustering: detectGeographicAnomalies(alert),
    timePatterns: detectTimeAnomalies(alert),
    amountPatterns: detectAmountAnomalies(transactions),
    riskScoreTrends: detectRiskTrends(transactions)
  };
  
  return patterns;
}
```

#### **Risk Assessment**
```typescript
function assessRisk(alert, riskAssessments, deviceActivity) {
  let threatLevel = calculateBaseThreatLevel(alert);
  let confidenceScore = calculateConfidence(riskAssessments);
  let falsePositiveRisk = assessFalsePositiveRisk(deviceActivity);
  
  return {
    threatLevel,
    confidenceScore,
    falsePositiveRisk,
    riskFactors: generateRiskFactors(alert, riskAssessments, deviceActivity)
  };
}
```

#### **Recommendation Generation**
```typescript
function generateRecommendations(alert, patterns, risk) {
  const recommendations = { immediate: [], shortTerm: [], longTerm: [] };
  
  // Immediate actions for critical threats
  if (risk.threatLevel === 'CRITICAL') {
    recommendations.immediate.push('Block suspicious IP addresses immediately');
    recommendations.immediate.push('Freeze affected user accounts');
  }
  
  // Pattern-based recommendations
  if (patterns.amountPatterns) {
    recommendations.immediate.push('Review recent high-value transactions');
  }
  
  return recommendations;
}
```
