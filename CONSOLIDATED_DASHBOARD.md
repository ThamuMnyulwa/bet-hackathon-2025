# Consolidated Dashboard

## Overview

The application has been restructured to consolidate the separate pages (Transactions, Project Sentinel, and Payments) into one comprehensive dashboard. This provides a better user experience by keeping all related functionality in one place while maintaining the same features and capabilities.

## What Changed

### Before (Separate Pages)
- `/dashboard` - Basic overview with quick access cards
- `/transactions` - Transaction history and management
- `/sentinel` - Project Sentinel security monitoring
- `/payments` - Payment form

### After (Consolidated Dashboard)
- `/dashboard` - Comprehensive dashboard with tabs for all sections
- All individual pages now redirect to the appropriate dashboard tab

## Dashboard Structure

The consolidated dashboard uses a tabbed interface with four main sections:

### 1. Overview Tab
- **Quick Stats Cards**: Total transactions, security score, active alerts, AI agent status
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to payment form and transaction history
- **Recent Activity**: Placeholder for future activity feed

### 2. Transactions Tab
- **Full Transaction History**: Complete `TransactionsDataTable` component
- **Analytics**: All transaction management features preserved
- **Filtering & Search**: Same functionality as the original transactions page

### 3. Project Sentinel Tab
- **Security Monitoring**: Complete `SentinelDashboard` component
- **Risk Analytics**: All security features preserved
- **Alert Management**: Same functionality as the original sentinel page

### 4. Payments Tab
- **Payment Form**: Complete `SecurePaymentForm` component
- **Security Features**: All payment protection features preserved
- **Validation**: Same functionality as the original payments page

## Navigation Updates

### Sidebar Navigation
- **Main Navigation**: Dashboard and AI Agent
- **Dashboard Sections**: Overview, Transactions, Project Sentinel, Payments
- Each section links directly to the appropriate tab with URL parameters

### URL Structure
- `/dashboard` - Default overview tab
- `/dashboard?tab=transactions` - Transactions tab
- `/dashboard?tab=sentinel` - Project Sentinel tab
- `/dashboard?tab=payments` - Payments tab

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Better User Experience**: All functionality in one place
2. **Reduced Navigation**: No need to switch between different pages
3. **Contextual Switching**: Easy to move between related sections
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All original features preserved
5. **Improved Workflow**: Seamless transition between payment, monitoring, and history

## Backward Compatibility

- All components and hooks remain unchanged

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- `TransactionsDataTable` - Transaction management

- Tab changes update both local state and URL

## Future Enhancements
